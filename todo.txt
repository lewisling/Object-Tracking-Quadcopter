//Find median of first n keypoints to find the rough centre of object? DONE
//1st implement yaw tracking
//Reduce resolution to increase speed -no effect
//Problem - not returning coordinates. solution - blob detectro was detecting by all parameters, readded 'false' to all except colour
//PIGPIO servo control
//piscope for viewing - compare traces! - Done with oscilloscope

//Code optimisation / compiling for four cores / multi-threading - Code slimmed down in numerous ways (reducing image size, reducing number of operations done on images, decrease number of calculations of contour moments, stopped displaying full images during object tracking process)
//Exchange blob detector for findContours - done

//Implement some form of PID control/feedback loop to tune down oscillations and make object tracking viable
//Check to see whether making header files has worked, compile everything
//Some weird integer float conversion stuff is happen
//Now getting big oscillations in tracking - failing to compensate for momentum etc? need tuning.



SPEED:
Added in time printing to find slowest part
two slowest sections were frame_capture (105ms) and pid_calculate (84ms) (obj_detect=9ms) t=198
Changed resize frame to 'linear' (size 256x144) -> f_c=39 o_d=9 p_c=116 t=164
Changed size to 320x240 (resize linear)-> f_c=82 o_d=32 p_c=84 t=198
changed resize 'nearest' size 256x144 -> f_c=39 o_d=9 p_c=150 t=198 

therefore ideal appears to be linear,256x144
could get faster using gpu acceleration but not realsitic on raspi - wrong architecture

//*** was failing to ignore the extra sleep calls which is why increase p_c time
//removed the restrictions on loop time to sample time so that loop can be faster - speed more important?
// -> Yes.

// will require retuning after speed adjustments? in process

//Increase acceptable error band? Change to if error < x -> x=1 - possible improvement?
//Increase I limit? I rarely reaches i limit, makes no change
